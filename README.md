# Sistemes de Codificaci√≥ de Video: seminar 3

### Exercise 1:
The first thing to be done in this exercise, was having the bbbVideo.mp4 converted into the following formats: 720p, 480p, 360x240 and 160x120. 
I have already done this conversions in the previous seminar (exercise 3).
Then we should use one of these videos, in my case I choose the bbbVideo.mp4 converted into 480p and cutted to an only 5 seconds video, to convert it to 4 other extensions: VP8, VP9, h265 and AV1.

### Create a video containing a mosaic of the 4 videos generated before (with different formats):
The creation of a video containing together the visualisation of the 4 formats in a mosaic is done with an ffmpeg command and you can find it in the 'Create4VideosMosaic.py' python file in this respository.

analyze by yourself and comment how these codecs work at each bitrate
